Just like most other developers, I started learning Ruby with a Rails project.

Many times I have listened to my developer peers describe the elegance and expressiveness of the Ruby language.
And they argued these points persuasively.

* Are these hash keys strings or symbols?
* Is this a HashWithIndifferentAccess?  Because then it wouldn't matter.
* Is this a property or a method?
